# Vivarium

Vivarium is an Arduino-based emotional communication device that enables users to record voice messages while receiving visual emotional feedback through an OLED display. It serves as a prototype for a conceptual device that creates emotionally safe spaces for communication when direct conversation isn't possible.

## Project Background
Vivarium was developed as a critical design project exploring how technological interventions might create spaces for emotional expression when direct communication is impossible or difficult. The device serves as both a functional prototype and a cultural probe to investigate how people address unresolved emotional needs.

## Features
1. Voice recording to microSD card in WAV format
2. Visual emotional feedback via changing emoji expressions on OLED display
3. Simple one-button operation for starting/stopping recording
4. LED indicator showing recording status
5. Portable, standalone operation (no computer required after setup)
